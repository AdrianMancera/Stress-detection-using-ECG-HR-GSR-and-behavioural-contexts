Hello, I am a student from the University Carlos 3 Madrid, Spain. 


I have a couple of questions if you don't mind, since I'm doing my final degree project on stress detection.

I was looking at public datasets to classify stress and I would like to know what dataset you are using. 
Because currently I have a model trained with another Wesad dataset, but I am interested in using yours as a test but I would like to know where you got that dataset from.

Sorry for modifying your repository but I have not found an email to contact. I attach mine 100429049@alumnos.uc3m.es
 
Regards, thank you
